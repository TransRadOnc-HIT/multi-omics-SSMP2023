ChatGPT

If you'd like to create a dictionary where the keys are the FrameOfReferenceUID values and the values are lists of the matching paths (both CT and PT), here's how you could modify the provided code:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}

    # Get PT paths and the associated FrameOfReferenceUID
    pt_paths = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/PT/*')
    if not pt_paths:
        return reference_dict

    pt_path = pt_paths[0]
    pt_frame_uid = pd.dcmread(glob.glob(pt_path+'/*')[0]).FrameOfReferenceUID

    if pt_frame_uid not in reference_dict:
        reference_dict[pt_frame_uid] = []

    reference_dict[pt_frame_uid].append(pt_path)

    # Get all CT paths
    ct_paths = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/CT/*')
    for ct_path in ct_paths:
        ct_frame_uid = pd.dcmread(glob.glob(ct_path+'/*')[0]).FrameOfReferenceUID

        if ct_frame_uid not in reference_dict:
            reference_dict[ct_frame_uid] = []

        reference_dict[ct_frame_uid].append(ct_path)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This code will build a dictionary where each key represents a unique FrameOfReferenceUID and the associated values are the paths of the matching DICOM files. It assumes you are using pydicom library and have imported it with alias pd.

Make sure to adjust the patient_path to your actual patient path before using.
User
not just pt and CT but everything iside
ChatGPT

Alright, if you want to gather all the studies inside the patient directory (be it PT, CT, or any other modality) and group them by their FrameOfReferenceUID, you can slightly modify the approach:

    You'd first need to get a list of all the studies inside the patient folder.
    Then, for each study, read the first DICOM file to get the FrameOfReferenceUID.
    Update the dictionary using this UID as a key and append the path to the list of paths associated with that UID.

Here's how you could do that:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}

    # Get paths of all studies inside the patient folder
    study_paths = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*')
    
    for study_path in study_paths:
        # Get the first DICOM file's FrameOfReferenceUID from this study
        frame_uid = pd.dcmread(glob.glob(study_path+'/*')[0]).FrameOfReferenceUID
        
        # Update the dictionary
        if frame_uid not in reference_dict:
            reference_dict[frame_uid] = []

        reference_dict[frame_uid].append(study_path)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This approach will group all studies (CT, PT, MR, etc.) inside the patient directory by their FrameOfReferenceUID. Make sure to adjust the patient_path to your actual patient path before using.
User
study_paths = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*') change this to look for .dcm files and then take the folder of it. make sure duplicates are removed
ChatGPT

Got it! To achieve this:

    Modify the glob.glob pattern to look for .dcm files specifically.
    Use os.path.dirname() to get the directory/folder containing each .dcm file.
    Use a set to ensure that duplicate paths are not considered.

Here's the updated code:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}
    
    # Set to hold unique study paths
    unique_study_paths = set()

    # Get paths of all .dcm files inside the patient folder
    dcm_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    
    # Extract unique study folders from .dcm file paths
    for dcm_file in dcm_files:
        study_path = os.path.dirname(dcm_file)
        unique_study_paths.add(study_path)
    
    for study_path in unique_study_paths:
        # Get the first DICOM file's FrameOfReferenceUID from this study
        frame_uid = pd.dcmread(glob.glob(study_path+'/*')[0]).FrameOfReferenceUID
        
        # Update the dictionary
        if frame_uid not in reference_dict:
            reference_dict[frame_uid] = []

        reference_dict[frame_uid].append(study_path)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This revised approach first identifies all the .dcm files, extracts their parent directories ensuring uniqueness using a set, and then groups these directories by their FrameOfReferenceUID.
User
sometimes its also dcm_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*.dcm')
ChatGPT

Got it. You can combine both patterns to ensure all potential .dcm file locations are considered. You can concatenate the results from the two glob operations and proceed as before:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}
    
    # Set to hold unique study paths
    unique_study_paths = set()

    # Get paths of all .dcm files inside the patient folder (both patterns)
    dcm_files_pattern1 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_files_pattern2 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*.dcm')
    
    all_dcm_files = dcm_files_pattern1 + dcm_files_pattern2

    # Extract unique study folders from .dcm file paths
    for dcm_file in all_dcm_files:
        study_path = os.path.dirname(dcm_file)
        unique_study_paths.add(study_path)
    
    for study_path in unique_study_paths:
        # Get the first DICOM file's FrameOfReferenceUID from this study
        frame_uid = pd.dcmread(glob.glob(study_path+'/*')[0]).FrameOfReferenceUID
        
        # Update the dictionary
        if frame_uid not in reference_dict:
            reference_dict[frame_uid] = []

        reference_dict[frame_uid].append(study_path)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This will ensure that you capture .dcm files regardless of whether they're one level deep or two levels deep in the directory structure.
User
the frameofrefernceuid is something in referencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
ChatGPT

Understood. If the FrameOfReferenceUID is located within the ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID, you'd need to access it accordingly. Here's how you can adjust the code to achieve this:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    
    # Accessing the nested attribute safely
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}
    
    # Set to hold unique study paths
    unique_study_paths = set()

    # Get paths of all .dcm files inside the patient folder (both patterns)
    dcm_files_pattern1 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_files_pattern2 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*.dcm')
    
    all_dcm_files = dcm_files_pattern1 + dcm_files_pattern2

    # Extract unique study folders from .dcm file paths
    for dcm_file in all_dcm_files:
        study_path = os.path.dirname(dcm_file)
        unique_study_paths.add(study_path)
    
    for study_path in unique_study_paths:
        # Get the first DICOM file's FrameOfReferenceUID from this study
        first_dcm_file = glob.glob(study_path+'/*')[0]
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(first_dcm_file)
        
        # If frame_uid exists, update the dictionary
        if frame_uid:
            if frame_uid not in reference_dict:
                reference_dict[frame_uid] = []
            reference_dict[frame_uid].append(study_path)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

In this revision, I've added a function get_frame_of_reference_uid that safely tries to retrieve the FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file. The rest of the code remains mostly the same, with the frame UID extraction updated to use the new function.
User
now adjust this so that the stucture set is the key and the items are the values. so if we have a frameofreference iud that have two rtsturct and then these should be two dict with the struct as key and the values duplictes in the two dict
ChatGPT

To modify the existing code such that:

    The structure set (RTSTRUCT) is the key in the dictionary.
    For each unique FrameOfReferenceUID, you build sub-dictionaries where the keys are the RTSTRUCTs and the values are associated items.

Here's how you can achieve this:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}

    # Get paths of all .dcm files inside the patient folder (both patterns)
    dcm_files_pattern1 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_files_pattern2 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*.dcm')

    all_dcm_files = dcm_files_pattern1 + dcm_files_pattern2

    # Build a map of FrameOfReferenceUID to its corresponding files
    for dcm_file in all_dcm_files:
        study_path = os.path.dirname(dcm_file)
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        
        if not frame_uid:
            continue
        
        if frame_uid not in reference_dict:
            reference_dict[frame_uid] = {}

        if "RTSTRUCT" in study_path:
            reference_dict[frame_uid][study_path] = []

    # Populate the RTSTRUCTs with their corresponding files
    for frame_uid, rtstructs in reference_dict.items():
        for dcm_file in all_dcm_files:
            study_path = os.path.dirname(dcm_file)
            if study_path in rtstructs:
                rtstructs[study_path].append(dcm_file)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

    Create an empty reference_dict.
    Identify all .dcm files in the patient folder.
    For each .dcm file, retrieve its FrameOfReferenceUID and determine if it's an RTSTRUCT based on its path.
    If it's an RTSTRUCT, it becomes a key in the sub-dictionary for its FrameOfReferenceUID. The value for this RTSTRUCT key is an empty list.
    Finally, populate the RTSTRUCT keys with their corresponding .dcm files.

Now, the structure will be something like:

yaml

{
    FrameOfReferenceUID_1: {
        RTSTRUCT_path_1: [...],
        RTSTRUCT_path_2: [...]
    },
    ...
}

Remember to adjust the logic if your naming and folder structures vary from what's assumed here.
User
let's change t like this. first get all rtsructs. then get the frame of reference uid of all other items and put them in the values of the rtstruct dict depengin on the frameofreference uid 
    dcm_files_pattern1 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_files_pattern2 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    
    all_dcm_files = dcm_files_pattern1 + dcm_files_pattern2

use this and then pick the rtstruct
ChatGPT

Alright, let's structure the code as per your instructions:

    First, get all RTSTRUCT paths.
    Then, loop through all .dcm files to fetch their FrameOfReferenceUID.
    Finally, organize these files under the relevant RTSTRUCT in the dictionary, using the FrameOfReferenceUID as the link between them.

Here's the code to achieve that:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}

    # Patterns to fetch .dcm files
    dcm_files_pattern1 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_files_pattern2 = glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/*.dcm')
    
    all_dcm_files = dcm_files_pattern1 + dcm_files_pattern2

    # Identify RTSTRUCT files
    rtstruct_files = [file for file in all_dcm_files if "RTSTRUCT" in file]

    # For each RTSTRUCT, fetch its FrameOfReferenceUID and set up a dictionary entry
    for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
        if frame_uid:
            reference_dict[rtstruct_file] = []
    
    # Loop through all other .dcm files and associate them with the right RTSTRUCT
    for dcm_file in all_dcm_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        
        for rtstruct_file, items in reference_dict.items():
            rtstruct_frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
            if frame_uid == rtstruct_frame_uid:
                items.append(dcm_file)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This should create a dictionary where each key is an RTSTRUCT file path, and its associated value is a list of all .dcm files that share the same FrameOfReferenceUID.
User
this takes to long to run. 
    reference_dict = {}

    # Patterns to fetch .dcm files
    rtstruct_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTSTRUCT/*/*.dcm')
    rtdose_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTDOSE/*/*.dcm')
    rtplan_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTPLAN/*/*.dcm')
    dcm_folders = [ x for x in glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/') if "RTSTRUCT" not in x]
    
adjust based on this to save time. see only the first slice in the dcm:_folders no need to read all frameofreferenceuid . from this build me a dict with struct as keys and the values are all the items that have the same frameofrefernec uid 
ChatGPT

If you're interested in optimizing the runtime, reading only the first slice from the folders is indeed a good strategy.

Given your provided patterns, here's an optimized version of the function:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd
import os

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    # Dictionary to hold the results
    reference_dict = {}

    # Patterns to fetch specific .dcm files
    rtstruct_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTSTRUCT/*/*.dcm')
    rtdose_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTDOSE/*/*.dcm')
    rtplan_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTPLAN/*/*.dcm')

    # Fetching folders excluding RTSTRUCT, and reading only the first slice for each
    dcm_folders = [x for x in glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/')]
    first_slices = [glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')[0] for folder in dcm_folders if glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')]

    # Combining all specific .dcm files and first slices into one list
    all_relevant_files = rtstruct_files + rtdose_files + rtplan_files + first_slices

    # For each RTSTRUCT, fetch its FrameOfReferenceUID and set up a dictionary entry
    for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
        if frame_uid:
            reference_dict[rtstruct_file] = []

    # Loop through the other relevant .dcm files and associate them with the right RTSTRUCT
    for dcm_file in all_relevant_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        
        for rtstruct_file, items in reference_dict.items():
            rtstruct_frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
            if frame_uid == rtstruct_frame_uid and dcm_file != rtstruct_file:  # Ensure we don't add the RTSTRUCT to its own list
                items.append(dcm_file)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

This function should be significantly faster than the previous versions since it reduces the number of files it has to process.
User
    for dcm_file in all_relevant_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        
        for rtstruct_file, items in reference_dict.items():
            rtstruct_frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
            if frame_uid == rtstruct_frame_uid and dcm_file != rtstruct_file:  # Ensure we don't add the RTSTRUCT to its own list
                items.append(dcm_file) this is taking to much time
ChatGPT

To further optimize the code, you can reduce the nested loop structure by storing the FrameOfReferenceUIDs of RTSTRUCT files beforehand. Here's how you can do that:

    Create a reverse lookup dictionary with the FrameOfReferenceUID of each RTSTRUCT as the key and the RTSTRUCT's path as the value.
    Then, for each file in all_relevant_files, retrieve its FrameOfReferenceUID and check if it's present in the reverse lookup dictionary. If it is, add it to the reference_dict under the corresponding RTSTRUCT.

Here's the optimized code:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    reference_dict = {}
    rtstruct_uid_lookup = {}

    # Patterns to fetch specific .dcm files
    rtstruct_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTSTRUCT/*/*.dcm')
    rtdose_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTDOSE/*/*.dcm')
    rtplan_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTPLAN/*/*.dcm')

    # Fetching folders excluding RTSTRUCT and reading only the first slice for each
    dcm_folders = [x for x in glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/')]
    first_slices = [glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')[0] for folder in dcm_folders if glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')]

    all_relevant_files = rtdose_files + rtplan_files + first_slices

    # Prepare a lookup for FrameOfReferenceUIDs of RTSTRUCT files
    for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
        if frame_uid:
            reference_dict[rtstruct_file] = []
            rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid] = rtstruct_file

    # Loop through the other relevant .dcm files and associate them with the right RTSTRUCT
    for dcm_file in all_relevant_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        if frame_uid in rtstruct_uid_lookup:
            rtstruct_file = rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid]
            reference_dict[rtstruct_file].append(dcm_file)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

By pre-storing the FrameOfReferenceUIDs of the RTSTRUCT files and avoiding the nested loop, this version should run faster.
User
also the values should not include any rtstruct eventhough we have the same frameofreferne
ChatGPT

Understood. We can simply filter out any RTSTRUCT paths from the values in the reference_dict.

Here's the modified code that excludes RTSTRUCT paths from the values:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):

            rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid] = rtstruct_file

    # Loop through the other relevant .dcm files and associate them with the right RTSTRUCT
    for dcm_file in all_relevant_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)

for this if multiple sttructure sets have the same frameofreferenceuid than maybe we save a list better to not replace 
ChatGPT

I see what you're getting at. If multiple RTSTRUCT files have the same FrameOfReferenceUID, you want them all to be included in the dictionary rather than just the last one. We can adjust the rtstruct_uid_lookup to map a FrameOfReferenceUID to a list of associated RTSTRUCT files.

Here's how you can make that change:

python

import glob
import pydicom as pd

def get_frame_of_reference_uid(dicom_file):
    """Retrieve FrameOfReferenceUID from the DICOM file."""
    dicom_data = pd.dcmread(dicom_file)
    try:
        return dicom_data.ReferencedFrameOfReferenceSequence[0].FrameOfReferenceUID
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        return None

def find_matching_paths(patient):
    reference_dict = {}
    rtstruct_uid_lookup = {}

    # Patterns to fetch specific .dcm files
    rtstruct_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTSTRUCT/*/*.dcm')
    rtdose_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTDOSE/*/*.dcm')
    rtplan_files = glob.glob(patient+'/*/RTPLAN/*/*.dcm')

    # Fetching folders excluding RTSTRUCT and reading only the first slice for each
    dcm_folders = [x for x in glob.glob(patient+'/*/*/*/*/')]
    first_slices = [glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')[0] for folder in dcm_folders if glob.glob(folder+'*.dcm')]

    all_relevant_files = rtdose_files + rtplan_files + first_slices

    # Prepare a lookup for FrameOfReferenceUIDs of RTSTRUCT files
    for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(rtstruct_file)
        if frame_uid:
            reference_dict[rtstruct_file] = []
            # Make sure the FrameOfReferenceUID maps to a list of RTSTRUCT files
            if frame_uid not in rtstruct_uid_lookup:
                rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid] = []
            rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid].append(rtstruct_file)

    # Loop through the other relevant .dcm files and associate them with the right RTSTRUCT
    for dcm_file in all_relevant_files:
        frame_uid = get_frame_of_reference_uid(dcm_file)
        if frame_uid in rtstruct_uid_lookup:
            for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_uid_lookup[frame_uid]:
                if "RTSTRUCT" not in dcm_file:
                    reference_dict[rtstruct_file].append(dcm_file)

    return reference_dict

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
result_dict = find_matching_paths(patient_path)
print(result_dict)

In this version, the rtstruct_uid_lookup dictionary maps each FrameOfReferenceUID to a list of corresponding RTSTRUCT files, ensuring that all RTSTRUCT files with the same FrameOfReferenceUID are taken into account.

now i want to convert each image with plastimatch as plastimatch_convert(ct,ct_out) , each dose with plastimatch_rtdose(rtdose[0],dd_out)  and then convert the rtsturct dicom with plastimatch_rtstruct(rtstruct,[],patient+'/roi_dd' ) where the image can be either the dose or the image. ignore ofcourse the RTPLAN. also output directory should be patient/new_process/{name of rtstruct file}/CT-{filename}.nii.nz for CT, /PT-{filename}.nii.nz for PT  and /DD-{filename}.nii.nz for RTDOSE and the platicm_rtstruct should be in folder /roi_{here either PT or CT or DD) depanding on what was used as the refernce we need for all possible iamges 
ChatGPT

I understand that you want to use the Plastimatch tool to convert various DICOM files into different formats. Let's go step-by-step:

    Convert each CT image with plastimatch_convert.
    Convert each RTDOSE with plastimatch_rtdose.
    Convert each RTSTRUCT DICOM with plastimatch_rtstruct.

Here's a Python script that should help with the conversion based on your instructions:

python

import os
import subprocess
import glob

def plastimatch_convert(input_path, output_path):
    cmd = ['plastimatch', 'convert', input_path, output_path]
    subprocess.run(cmd)

def plastimatch_rtdose(input_path, output_path):
    cmd = ['plastimatch', 'rtdose', input_path, output_path]
    subprocess.run(cmd)

def plastimatch_rtstruct(rtstruct_path, img_list, output_dir):
    cmd = ['plastimatch', 'rtstruct', rtstruct_path] + img_list + [output_dir]
    subprocess.run(cmd)

def process_patient_files(patient_path):
    # Create output directory
    output_dir = os.path.join(patient_path, "new_process")
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Patterns to fetch specific .dcm files
    rtstruct_files = glob.glob(patient_path + '/*/RTSTRUCT/*/*.dcm')
    rtdose_files = glob.glob(patient_path + '/*/RTDOSE/*/*.dcm')
    ct_files = glob.glob(patient_path + '/*/*/CT/*/*.dcm')
    pt_files = glob.glob(patient_path + '/*/*/PT/*/*.dcm')

    for rtstruct_file in rtstruct_files:
        rtstruct_name = os.path.basename(rtstruct_file).split('.')[0]
        rtstruct_output_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, rtstruct_name)
        os.makedirs(rtstruct_output_dir, exist_ok=True)

        # Convert CT files
        for ct in ct_files:
            ct_out = os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'CT-{os.path.basename(ct)}.nii.nz')
            plastimatch_convert(ct, ct_out)
            plastimatch_rtstruct(rtstruct_file, [ct_out], os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'roi_CT'))

        # Convert PT files
        for pt in pt_files:
            pt_out = os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'PT-{os.path.basename(pt)}.nii.nz')
            plastimatch_convert(pt, pt_out)
            plastimatch_rtstruct(rtstruct_file, [pt_out], os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'roi_PT'))

        # Convert RTDOSE files
        for rtdose in rtdose_files:
            dd_out = os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'DD-{os.path.basename(rtdose)}.nii.nz')
            plastimatch_rtdose(rtdose, dd_out)
            plastimatch_rtstruct(rtstruct_file, [dd_out], os.path.join(rtstruct_output_dir, f'roi_DD'))

patient_path = "path_to_patient_folder"
process_patient_files(patient_path)

Please ensure:

    You have set the path to the Plastimatch binaries in your system's PATH variable, or adjust the commands in the functions above to point directly to the Plastimatch binaries.
    You backup your original data before running scripts that modify or create new files.
    Adjust the paths as necessary based on your directory structure or if the glob patterns don't exactly match your needs.

User
          out_dir = patient + '/new_process/' + key.split('/')[-2].split('-')[-1]
            os.makedirs(out_dir,exists_OK=True)
ChatGPT

I see you're trying to create an output directory using parts of the key's path. The os.makedirs() function has the exist_ok parameter, not exists_OK. Let's fix that. Here's the corrected code:

python

out_dir = os.path.join(patient, 'new_process', key.split('/')[-2].split('-')[-1])
os.makedirs(out_dir, exist_ok=True)

This code takes the path in the variable key, isolates the second last directory, splits it on the '-' character and takes the last part to form the name of the output directory. It then creates the directory if it does not already exist.
User
rename dir from out_dir = out_dir+_"plan"
ChatGPT

If you want to rename the directory after it's created, you can use os.rename(). Here's how you can do that:

python

new_dir_name = out_dir + "_plan"
os.rename(out_dir, new_dir_name)

Make sure you use new_dir_name for subsequent operations since out_dir would no longer exist after the rename operation.
User
it's not empty
ChatGPT

If the directory is not empty, you can still rename it with os.rename(). The contents of the directory don't interfere with renaming the directory itself.

However, if you're encountering any issues, please provide more context or the exact error message so I can assist further.

To ensure that the directory you're trying to rename does not clash with an existing directory name, you might want to first check if the new_dir_name already exists and handle that situation appropriately.

Here's a slightly more robust version:

python

new_dir_name = out_dir + "_plan"

if os.path.exists(new_dir_name):
    print(f"Directory {new_dir_name} already exists. Choose a different name or handle this situation.")
else:
    os.rename(out_dir, new_dir_name)

If the directory new_dir_name exists, this will prevent renaming and notify you of the situation.

from this i dont undertance if i showed use reference-ct or fxed 

Examples¶

The first example demonstrates how to convert a DICOM volume to NRRD. The DICOM images that comprise the volume must be stored in a single directory, which for this example is called “dicom-in-dir”. Because the –output-type option was not specified, the output type will be matched to the type of the input DICOM volume. The format of the output file (NRRD) is determined from the filename extension.

plastimatch convert \
  --input dicom-in-dir \
  --output-img outfile.nrrd

This example further converts the type of the image intensities to float.

plastimatch convert \
  --input dicom-in-dir \
  --output-img outfile.nrrd \
  --output-type float

The next example shows how to resample the output image to a different geometry. The –origin option sets the position of the (center of) the first voxel of the image, the –dim option sets the number of voxels, and the –spacing option sets the distance between voxels. The units for origin and spacing are assumed to be millimeters.

plastimatch convert \
  --input dicom-in-dir \
  --output-img outfile.nrrd \
  --origin "-200 -200 -165" \
  --dim "250 250 110" \
  --spacing "2 2 2.5"

Generally speaking, it is tedious to manually specify the geometry of the output file. If you want to match the geometry of the output file with an existing file, you can do this using the –fixed option.

plastimatch convert \
  --input dicom-in-dir \
  --output-img outfile.nrrd \
  --fixed reference.nrrd

This next example shows how to convert a DICOM RT structure set file into an image using the –output-ss-img option. Because structures in DICOM RT are polylines, they are rasterized to create the image. The voxels of the output image are 32-bit integers, where the i^th bit of each integer has value one if the voxel lies with in the corresponding structure, and value zero if the voxel lies outside the structure. The structure names are stored in separate file using the –output-ss-list option.

plastimatch convert \
  --input structures.dcm \
  --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
  --output-ss-list outfile.txt

In the previous example, the geometry of the output file wasn’t specified. When the geometry of a DICOM RT structure set isn’t specified, it is assumed to match the geometry of the DICOM (CT, MR, etc) image associated with the contours. If the associated DICOM image is in the same directory as the structure set file, it will be found automatically. Otherwise, we have to tell plastimatch where it is located with the –referenced-ct option.

plastimatch convert \
  --input structures.dcm \
  --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
  --output-ss-list outfile.txt \
  --referenced-ct ../image-directory

ChatGPT

From the given documentation, Plastimatch provides utilities for converting DICOM files into other formats and offers several options depending on what you want to achieve. Here's a breakdown:

    Basic Conversion: Converts DICOM volume in a directory (dicom-in-dir) to an NRRD format.

    bash

plastimatch convert --input dicom-in-dir --output-img outfile.nrrd

Specifying Output Type: If you want to change the type of the image intensities, you can specify the --output-type.

bash

plastimatch convert --input dicom-in-dir --output-img outfile.nrrd --output-type float

Geometry Resampling: This option is used when you want to resample the output image to a different geometry by specifying the origin, dimension, and spacing.

bash

plastimatch convert --input dicom-in-dir --output-img outfile.nrrd --origin "-200 -200 -165" --dim "250 250 110" --spacing "2 2 2.5"

Matching Geometry with an Existing File: Instead of manually specifying geometry, you can match the geometry of the output file with an existing file using --fixed.

bash

plastimatch convert --input dicom-in-dir --output-img outfile.nrrd --fixed reference.nrrd

Convert DICOM RT Structure Set: For converting a DICOM RT structure set file into an image, you use --output-ss-img. The structure names are stored in a separate file using --output-ss-list.

bash

plastimatch convert --input structures.dcm --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd --output-ss-list outfile.txt

Specify the Referenced CT: If the associated DICOM image isn't in the same directory as the structure set file, you should specify its location with --referenced-ct.

bash

    plastimatch convert --input structures.dcm --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd --output-ss-list outfile.txt --referenced-ct ../image-directory

In summary:

    If you want to match the geometry of the output file with an existing file, you should use the --fixed option.
    If you're converting DICOM RT structure sets and need to specify where the associated DICOM image is, then you should use the --referenced-ct option.

Your decision on whether to use --fixed or --referenced-ct should be based on the specific goal of your conversion. If it's geometry matching, use --fixed; if it's pointing to the associated DICOM image while converting RT structures, then use --referenced-ct.
